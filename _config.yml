          Began graduate career by revamping a <mark>Ruby</mark> <mark>RSpec</mark> test harness.
          Additionally, added <mark>Jenkins</mark> automation into the testing process, reducing the time to test builds and increasing confidence in a
          software releases.

          Assessed feasibility, designed and implemented a <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Pytest</mark> test harness for a large component for a time critical project.
          Managed, mentored and reviewed two other graduates on the project. Created and deployed the test harness using a container based mechanism.
          Co-ordinated with colleagues and introduced a test-driven development process using the test-harness.

          Modernised the build system and components for a department, including writing a <mark>Jenkins</mark> groovy shared library, developing a new RPM publishing and development workflow and
          uplifting more than two dozen <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>C++</mark> components from Centos 7 to AlmaLinux 9.

          **[Read Dissertation In Full](./assets/geolocation_in_a_rainforest.pdf)**

          Traditionally GPS provides Radiolocation outside with successful results;
          however in some environments such as the rainforest this provides inaccurate results due
          to environmental factors.
          The project aimed to build a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation system to produce more accurate results.

          Received a first for the 10000 word dissertation with the project results being a promising
          indicator of real world use cases for the technology.
