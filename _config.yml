          Assessed feasibility, designed and implemented a Python Pytest test harness for a large component for a time critical
          project. Created and deployed the test harness using a container based mechanism.

          Managed, mentored and reviewed two other graduates on the project. Co-ordinated with colleagues and introduced a
          test-driven development process using the test-harness into the team

          Created an automated deployment and test pipeline for a system of components using Jenkins/Ansible, this reduced
          deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes. In addition to having reproducible deployments of development
          infrastructure.

          Modernised the build system and components for a department, including writing a Jenkins groovy shared library.

          Influenced the development of a new RPM publishing and developer workflow uplifting more than two dozen Python
          and C++ components from Centos 7 to AlmaLinux 9.

          Collaborated on a challenging project that involved extending a legacy test harness using python.

          Introduced continuous integration into the test harness repository, using a Jenkins pipeline, this streamlined the development process and improved confidence in the code.

          Gained industry experience with Python, Docker, continuous integration techniques and RH-based OS Linux.

          Picked key skills such as team work and project management.
          Majority of modules focused on concepts with languages being learnt by implementing these practically.
          Gained the ability to quickly pick up new languages and technologies some of these include: OCaml, Java, C/C++, Python, SQL, Prolog, Git and Verilog.
          Favourite modules included: Concurrent and Distributed Computing, Advanced Computer Architecture and Optimising Compilers.

          While at Cambridge spent free time attending Hackathons, exploring the gorgeous Cambridgeshire countryside and partaking in societies.

          Traditionally GPS provides Radiolocation outside with successful results;
          however in some environments such as the rainforest this provides inaccurate results due
          to environmental factors.
          The project aimed to build a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation system to produce more accurate results.

          Received a first for the 10000 word dissertation with the project results being a promising
          indicator of real world use cases for the technology.
