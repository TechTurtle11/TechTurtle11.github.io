  Hi my name is Thomas Barker, I'm a Software Developer currently specialising in application development in <mark>python</mark> and <mark>C++</mark>.
  I am currently working for BAE Systems Digital Intelligence on some exciting projects.

  I enjoy creating modern and scalable software solutions to unconventional problems. I enjoy to create clean and efficient developer experiences
  with a focus on code quality and reducing overall development time. I have developed with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new.
  The technologies that I currently have the most experience  with are <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Jenkins</mark>, <mark>Git</mark> and <mark>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</mark>.

          Began graduate career by revamping a <mark>Ruby</mark> <mark>RSpec</mark> test harness.
          Additionally, added <mark>Jenkins</mark> automation into the testing process, reducing the time to test builds and increasing confidence in a
          software releases.

          Assessed feasibility, prototyped, designed and implemented a <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Pytest</mark> test harness for a large component for a time critical project. This included:
          managing, coordinating and reviewing two other graduates work on the project. Developed and deployed the test harness using a container based mechanism.
          Successfully co-ordinated with colleagues and introduced a test-driven development process using the test-harness.

          Modernised the build system and components for a department, including writing a <mark>Jenkins</mark> shared library, developing a new RPM publishing and development workflow and
          uplifting more than two dozen <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>C++</mark> components from Centos 7 to AlmaLinux 9.

          During my internship at BAE Systems, I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project that involved extending a test harness using python.
          This experience taught me a great deal about practical development on RH-based Linux OSs, and I gained valuable hands-on experience working with these technologies.

          One of my proudest achievements during this internship was introducing continuous integration to the test harness, using a <mark>Jenkins</mark> pipeline.
          This addition helped to streamline our development process and improving confidence in produced code.

          As I Implemented the project, I was constantly seeking out ways to improve our methods and tools. I researched and tested new approaches, and shared my findings with my colleagues,
          helping us all to work more efficiently and effectively.

          Overall, my experience conducting this project was incredibly rewarding. I learned a great deal about software engineering,
          honed my skills in <mark>python</mark>, <mark>docker</mark>, and continuous integration techniques, and gained my first practical <mark>RH-based OS Linux</mark> development experience.

          Volunteered to help a friend develop the backend for there sustainable choice app/web application.
          Led the backend coding team on this project, creating the web API using the <mark>Django</mark> <mark>REST</mark> framework. Developed the deployment mechanism to the linux server backend.
          This was my first opportunity to lead software engineers and deploying an application, this opportunity has gave me the drive for personal and team development.

          As part of the googles summer of code scheme extended Open Roberta's robot simulation stack machine interpreter in <mark>typescript</mark>
          to allow users to see the current code executing by highlighting the code blocks. Also developed debugging functionality for
          the robot simulation in typescript for users. Completed final testing and provided a demo of work as a part of the end of
          project presentation. This was well received by the Senior team members.

          Working with a pre-established open-source codebase, was a fascinating learning opportunity. In addition, this was good exposer to how compilers and robots algorithms operate efficiently.

          During my degree at the University Of Cambridge I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management.
          Although we mostly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use lot of these skills to my advantage
          in my day to day work. My course focused mostly of practical concepts with languages expected to be learnt alongside modules. Due to this approach I learnt the ability
          to quickly pick up a new languages and technologies some of these include: <mark>OCaml</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>C/C++</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Prolog</mark>, <mark>Git</mark> and <mark>Verilog</mark>.
          Some of my favourite modules included: <mark>Concurrent and Distributed Computing</mark>,
          <mark>Advanced Computer Architecture</mark> and <mark>Optimising Compilers</mark>.

          While at Cambridge spent my free time attending various Hackathons, exploring the gorgeous Cambridgeshire countryside and partaking in various societies.

          **[Read Dissertation In Full](./assets/geolocation_in_a_rainforest.pdf)**

          Traditionally GPS is used to provide Radiolocation outside with successful results;
          however in some environments such as the rainforest this provides inaccurate results due
          to environmental factors. The project aimed to build a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
          localisation system to produce more accurate results. I received a first in my Dissertation and the project results were a promising
          indicator that the model may be able to be applied to mapping in the rainforest.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs

      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a few sports such as mountain biking,
      walking and running as well as trying to make time for things like rock climbing and swimming.

      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me fixing my bike, at the cinema watching the latest release or down at the pub with some friends.
